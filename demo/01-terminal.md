# Demo - Interactive Terminal

## Markdown

What you see here is a notebook, written in Markdown. It has multiple code blocks. We can send them to the interactive terminal on the right.

## Send shell commands

```shell:terminal
sleep 2
echo "Wake up, Neo..."
```

## Run code in a REPL

```shell:terminal
node
```

```javascript:terminal
console.log("The Matrix probably has a JS port...");
process.exit();
```

## Notebooks Explorer

Below you see the notebooks explorer. `Return` loads the next notebook.
