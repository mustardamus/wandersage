# Notebooks Explorer

The notebooks explorer helps to navigate notebooks, if there are multiple `.md` in the same folder.

It is shown if a folder is passed to Wandersage, and at the end of a notebook, but only if there are multiple `.md` notebooks in the same folder as the currently loaded notebook.

The entries are sorted by the filename. So if you want a specific order of notebooks, lead the filenames with a number: `01-intro.md`, `02-next.md`, etc.

For convenience, the next entry from the currently loaded notebook is pre-selected, so a `Return` press brings the user right to the next notebook in the list. If the loaded notebook is the last in the list, the first entry is pre-selected.

You can also filter the entries by pressing `/` and entering the search term. `ESC` twice, to go back to the whole list.
